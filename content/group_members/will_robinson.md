## Bio

If you'd like to know more, here's my academic life story:

When I started my degree, I was quite interested in artificial photosynthesis.
This interest first led me to working in the group of [Prof. Julia
Weinstein](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/mps/people/chemistry-staff/julia-weinstein)
(University of Sheffield) for a year. I spent much of my time focussed on ligand
synthesis under the guidance of Dr. Paul Scattergood. We were predominantly
interested in how ligand electronic structure would affect the photophysical
properties of donor-acceptor Pt(II) complexes, if we could create long-lived
charge-separated states, and whether we could get them to anchor on
TiO<sub>2</sub> to make dye sensitised solar cells. Being part of Julia's group
meant that I also learned a lot about time-resolved spectroscopy.

After I graduated from Sheffield, I moved to the University of Cambridge to
study for my PhD as part of the EPSRC-funded
[NanoDTC](https://www.nanodtc.cam.ac.uk/). The first year of this program taught
all the materials science, physics, chemistry and even biology surrounding
nanotechnology. It was a great way to see a lot of the university, as well as to
meet and work with some great scientists and engineers.

I joined [Prof. Erwin Reisner's group](http://www-reisner.ch.cam.ac.uk/index.html)
for my thesis work where I found my way to enzyme electrochemistry and CO{{< sub 2 >}}reduction.
Through this project, I also worked with [Prof. Judy Hirst](https://www.mrc-mbu.cam.ac.uk/research-groups/hirst-group),
who taught me a lot. The enzyme was formate dehydrogenase H from *E. coli*, which,
when immobilised on an electrode can both reduce CO{{< sub 2 >}} to formate, and
oxidise formate to CO{{< sub 2 >}}. With my colleagues, we collected quite
extensive data on the steady-state and pre-equilibrium behaviour of FDH and used
kinetic models to unify and rationalise these data. We made some quite unique
data sets, but we'll see how our conclusions on the mechanism fare...

I spent another postdoctoral year in Erwin's group in which we developed
semi-artificial photosynthetic devices which out-performed natural
photosynthesis in a few key ways. In short, they could absorb more wavelengths
of light, and transfer electrons from water to protons or CO{{< sub 2 >}} more
efficiently than natural systems. So, artificial photosynthesis: done? Not
exactly!

Coming from the solar fuels field, I started to getting used to the idea
that mimicking photosynthesis is a rather linear affair. Light comes in,
supplies energy to move electrons from water to acceptors like CO{{< sub 2 >}} or
H{{<sup "\+" >}}. That's hard enough to do with synthetic systems!
But really, natural photosynthesis is so successful and interesting because it
is a *system* in which many reaction and energy transfer processes are taking
place simultaneously. Can chemistry be performed and studied as a system? This
idea led me to work quite extensively in the group of [Prof. Wilhelm
Huck](https://www.hucklab.com/) on prebiotic systems chemistry, with funding
from the Simons Foundation's Collaboration on the Origin of Life. During this
period, we did a lot of work in developing the science and methods required for
looking at chemical reactions as systems, using the formose reaction as a model
system.

In trying to understand systems chemistry, I ended up working with methods which
produce a reasonably large amount of complicated reaction data. Perhaps dealing
with all of this in the lab, as well as at a computer has led me to my current
position as Group Leader in Chemistry and AI in the RobotLab and the Big
Chemistry Consortium. Here, I will be furthering my work into complex reaction
systems alongside developing a research programme which interfaces chemistry and
AI.
