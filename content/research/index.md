# Chemical Reaction Systems

We look at chemistry as a collection of compounds behaving as systems. Rather
than looking at chemistry molecule-by-molecule, we take a top-down approach, and
investigate their collective behaviour. This view is heavily inspired by the way
biological systems work. Experimentally speaking, flow chemistry and
chromatographic reaction characterisation are key techniques in our lab', and we
call on methods from data science and machine learning to understand our data.

# Machine Learning and Chemistry

Chemical properties and reactivity are complex, especially in mixtures of
compounds. We are exploring the relationship between molecular structure,
solution composition, and properties using machine learning and AI. We're
interested in how these models can be trained efficiently with experimental
data, how they can provide useful predictions, and how they may be used to
inform experimental investigations. Current projects involve the use of Chemical
Language Models and graph-neural networks for the prediction of aqueous
solubility and critical micellar concentration.
