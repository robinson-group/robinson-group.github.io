# Chemistry and AI

Since 2024, I have taught the Chemistry and AI Master's course at Radboud
University Nijmegen. The lectures for the 2025 edition have just wrapped up (you
can find the course details here:
[2025](https://ru.osiris-student.nl/onderwijscatalogus/extern/cursus?cursuscode=NWI-MOL433&collegejaar=2025)).

Chemistry and AI is targeted at students of chemistry and the molecular
sciences, and aims to provide students with concepts and practical skills in
machine learning, coding and informatics to solve problems in chemistry. The
course assumes no foreknowledge besides chemistry. It provides introductory
material on standard machine learning and statistical concepts, and Python
programming (no prior experience required). As such, this is effectively a
crash-course in machine learning taught over seven lectures and practical
sessions (around 12 contact hours). The emphasis is on building intuition on key
machine learning concepts with direct reference to illustrative chemistry
examples such as C--H bond activation, Metal-Organic Frameworks, and solubility
prediction. Significant attention is paid to the practical implementations of ML
methodology via Python code. A side effect is that students will be introduced
to and will practice programming and working with data.

Students who take this course will gain a good foundation in ML which will
provide a basis for learning more advanced topics, and will aid their
communication with AI/ML/Data Science specialists.

An outline for the 2025 course is given below.
