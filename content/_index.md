# Welcome!

Hello there,

Welcome to the Robinson Group website. We're interested in looking at chemistry in new ways.
Inspired by the biological world around us, we're exploring chemical reactions as [self-organising systems]({{< relref "research" >}}).
We're also into applying machine learning and AI for predicting and understanding chemical data.

We are embedded in the Department of Physical Organic Chemistry, [Institute for Molecules and Materials](https://www.ru.nl/imm/), Radboud University Nijmegen, the [Big Chemistry Consortium](https://bigchemistry.nl/), developing the RobotLab.
