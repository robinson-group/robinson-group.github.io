# Welcome

Hello there,

Welcome to the Robinson Group website. We're interested in looking at chemistry
in new ways.

Inspired by the biological world around us, we're exploring chemical reactions as
[self-organising systems](link).

We're also into applying machine learning and AI for predicting and
understanding chemical data.

Once upon a time, we worked on artificial photosynthesis and enzyme
(photo-)electrocatalysis. One day, we'll get back to it!

## Where are we?

We're part of the [Big Chemistry Consortium](https://bigchemistry.nl/),
developing the RobotLab.

Also, we are part of the Department of Physical Organic Chemistry, [Institute for
Molecules and Materials](https://www.ru.nl/imm/), Radboud University Nijmegen,
alongside our colleagues in:

- [Huck Group](https://www.hucklab.com/)
- [Mabesoone Group](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/mathijs-mabesoone-49915770)
- [Korevaar Group](https://www.korevaarlab.com/)
- [Spruijt Lab](https://spruijtlab.com/)
- [Velema Lab](https://www.velemalab.com/)
- [Hansen Lab](https://www.thehansenlab.com/)

## Other stuff

You can find some scientific code tools and noodling on [Will's
GitHub](https://github.com/Will-Robin).
